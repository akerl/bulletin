Service for exposing dynamic information from other services for collection and parsing

## Purpose

Here are some of the design goals of bulletin:

* Allow diverse applications to easily expose information without requiring manual changes to a centralized system
* Require zero runtime dependencies, allowing bulletin to be easily loaded alongside existing systems
* Expose timestamps alongside all data, to allow external observers to passively validate the age of exposed data
* Provide a minimal HTTP interface to limit attack surface and simplify communication
* Accept and serve data using YAML
